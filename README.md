# snmp-mib-files

This repository contains a set of standard SNMP MIB files which come with every installation of a
[Dynatrace ActiveGate](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/dynatrace-activegate).
You can read more about how these files are used in the
[online documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/snmp-extensions-reference#mib-files).

The purpose of this repository is to allow users to understand what is already available and when
they might need to supply their own MIB files (for example, as part of an
[Extension](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/extensions20/data-sources/snmp-extensions))
to benefit from the same features.

These files were checked with Dynatrace ActiveGate 1.281 (released 08-Jan-2024)
